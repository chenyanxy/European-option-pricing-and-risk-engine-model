Option Pricing & Risk Engine

This project implements a compact but fully functional framework for valuing European options and analysing their risk under multiple quantitative models. It combines Monte Carlo simulation, finite-difference PDE methods and jump-diffusion dynamics, providing a flexible structure for experimentation, research or teaching.

The system begins by loading all market and model settings from a unified configuration file, including spot price, strike, volatility, interest rate, maturity, simulation sizes and jump parameters. These inputs feed into several pricing engines. The Monte Carlo module simulates large batches of geometric Brownian motion paths, computes the terminal payoff of a European call and discounts the average to produce the option value. A jump-diffusion variant extends this approach by introducing Poisson-driven price jumps to capture fat-tailed behaviour. Alongside the simulation methods, a full Crank–Nicolson finite-difference solver prices the same option by numerically solving the Black–Scholes PDE on a grid and stepping backwards in time from maturity to the present.

Beyond valuation, the project integrates a simple but effective risk engine. By perturbing key inputs such as the underlying price or volatility and re-pricing the option, it estimates core Greeks including delta, gamma and vega using central-difference approximations. It also performs scenario-driven stress testing and produces Value-at-Risk and Conditional VaR estimates using Monte Carlo loss distributions. Additional utility functions allow uncertainty sampling of parameters to support more robust scenario analysis.

The main.py file ties everything together. It imports the pricing engines, runs the PDE and Monte Carlo models, executes the risk calculations and prints out a summary of results. The structure is modular, making it easy to extend with new models, add payoff types or adapt the risk components to more complex analysis. Overall, this repository serves as a small quantitative toolkit for option pricing, model comparison and risk evaluation, suitable for academic exploration or practical prototyping.
